        <h3>Web Applications Development</h3>
        <!-- <p>⭐️⭐️</p> -->
        <p class="webAppDescription">I am growing my skillset for building and managing Web Applications. I first began developing class management software on the Apple IIe personal computer, then on the IBM PC XT and ultimately on many frameworks. As Director of Web
          Technologies for <a href="https://acadiemgroup.com"><strong>The Acadiem Group</strong></a>, I continue to expand my repertoire by moving toward mobile responsive technologies.</p>

        <!-- <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p> -->
        <p class="softDevDescription">I enjoy the challenge of designing work layouts for ergonomic software to create an efficient flow of data collection and presentation. My first programming began in high school, where I took on the challenge of earning an extra credit in
          programming (using Fortran WATFIV) to improve my development of software algoriths. I wrote a simple spreadsheet for AppleIIe and then developed a macro-based software application for coordinating and managing Referee Schedules and Payment.
          <em>The Official Scheduler</em> was my first commercially available software package. Expanding my business experience, I helped to develop <em>MarkBook® Class Management Software</em> with <strong>sylum Software Inc.</strong>A as Director of Web Technologies./p>

        <h3>Certified Apple Teacher</h3>
        <!-- <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p> -->
        <p>Working with Mac OS7 through to macOS (in all of its forms from Cheetah to Mojave) and later iOS, I have produced numerous documents for teaching using Pages, Numbers and Keynote. As a Certified Apple Teacher, I enjoy promoting the Apple
          experience in both the desktop and mobile frameworks, especially since iOS (with the advent of iPad) has exploded the popularity of this technology. Since retiring, many of these documents are for personal productivity and enrichment.</p>

        <p>In the PC ecosystem, I have kept current on using Microsoft's Windows® operating system to efficiently use Word, Excel and Powerpoint along with many third-party applications for personal use.</p>

        <h3>Google Applications</h3>
        <!-- <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p> -->
        <p>Lately, I have laterally shifted my enthusiasm to the Cloud. Using Google® Drive and the comparable suite of GoogleApps (Docs, Sheets, and to a lesser extent Slides), I have become a fan of ChromeOS<sup>TM</sup> and its liberating Cloud Experience.

        <p>Scaling my business opportunities, I have produced websites for Engagements, Businesses and Volunteer Associations. As with any business, word-of-mouth and my clients' experiences have led me to further expand my opportunities to use my creative talents to enrich my clients' lives.</p>
